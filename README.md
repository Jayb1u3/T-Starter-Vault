# Obsidian Starter Vault

Welcome to your new Obsidian vault! This vault is designed to help you transition from **note taking** to **note making**. It serves as a starting point for organizing your thoughts, knowledge, and projects in a structured way. I will be including, over time, templates (including for templater and dataview) that I personally find useful. This README will guide you through the key features and resources available in this vault.

## Getting Started

1. **Duplicate This Vault**: Before you start using this vault, it's recommended to duplicate it. This allows you to use this setup for other projects in the future without losing your initial configuration.

2. **Home Base**: Start your journey from the `000 Home` note, where you will find links to various resources and guides to help you get the most out of Obsidian.

3. **Start Here**: Navigate from the `000 Home` note to explore the example vault and see how you can implement it in your daily life.

## Key Features

### Importing Notes
Use the [Importer plugin](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Importer) to bring in notes from other platforms into Obsidian.

### Creating and Formatting Notes
- **Creating New Notes**: Learn how to create notes with ease. Refer to the `Creating New Notes` guide.
- **Formatting Text**: Master Markdown formatting with the `Formatting Text` note, which covers headings, bold text, italics, and more.
- **Advanced Formatting**: Dive deeper with the `Advanced Formatting Syntax` note, where you'll learn about tables, diagrams using Mermaid, and mathematical expressions using MathJax.

### Using Plugins
