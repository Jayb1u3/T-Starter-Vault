# Obsidian Starter Vault

Welcome to your new Obsidian vault! This vault is designed to help you transition to Obsidian. It serves as a starting point for organizing your thoughts, knowledge, and projects in a structured way. Over time, I will include templates (templates for templater and dataview) that I find useful. This README will guide you through the key features and resources available in this vault.

## Getting Started

1. **Duplicate This Vault**: It's recommended that you duplicate this vault before you start using it. This allows you to use this setup for other projects in the future without losing your initial configuration.

2. **Home Base**: Start your journey from the `000 Home` note, where you will find links to various resources and guides to help you get the most out of Obsidian.

3. **Start Here**: Navigate from the `000 Home` note to explore the example vault and see how you can implement it in your daily life.

## Key Features
